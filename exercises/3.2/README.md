# Exercise 3.2: Pointy-haired boss

Here you've been given the `Point` struct type, and you have two jobs:

1. Define an interface `OnlyPoint` whose type set is only `Point`.

2. Write generic functions `GetX[T]` and `GetY[T]`, constrained by the `OnlyPoint` interface. They should return the X and Y values of the given point.

If you'd like some clues, have a look at [Solution 3.2](../../solutions/3.2/point.go).
